            <p class="lead text-body-secondary mt-3 mx-auto" style="max-width: 720px;">Sneakslab was developed by a dedicated duo of aspiring software engineers from the University of Baguio. What began as a school project quickly grew into a vision for a fully functional sneaker e-commerce platform that combines both practicality and passion for technology. This project represents a stepping stone toward our shared dream of becoming professional software engineers.</p>
